Gauss-Jordan Elimination
This Python script implements the Gauss-Jordan elimination method for solving systems of linear equations. It takes coefficient matrices a and constant vectors b as input and returns the solution(s) or indicates if the system has no solution or infinite solutions.

Usage
To use this script, follow these steps:

Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
Install the required dependencies (numpy).
bash
Copy code
pip install numpy
Copy the gaussjordan function into your project or import it directly.
Create coefficient matrix a and constant vector b for your system of linear equations.
Call the gaussjordan function with a and b as arguments.
Example:

python
Copy code
import numpy as np

def gaussjordan(a, b):
    # Implementation here...

a = [[0, 2, 9, 5],
     [4, 6, 2, 5],
     [1, 5, 4, 8],
     [3, 4, 7, 5]]
b = [2, 6, 9, 3]

print(gaussjordan(a, b)) 
Function Description
The gaussjordan function performs Gauss-Jordan elimination on the coefficient matrix a and constant vector b. It returns a string describing the steps of the elimination process and the solution(s) if found.
